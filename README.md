# Predict IoT device geolocation

Predict the geolocation of IoT devices, based on the metadata of the messages they emit.
The messages are received by stations belonging to the 0G network deployed by Sigfox.

The guidelines are taken from a course project at Télécom Paris, for an IoT course given by Sigfox.
